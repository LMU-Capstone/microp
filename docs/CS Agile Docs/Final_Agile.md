# Retrospective Summary
  Natalia and Ian used SCRUM in their Agile planning with weekly standups Tuesdays at 8am. The springs were roughly broken up into Design and Preparation, Hardware Construction, and Validation & Verification. Standups were performed with Dr. Asghari of the EECE Department.

# Epics / Stories

My stories were lost when sprints were completed and I'm very confused on how to recover them. To that end, they are re-typed here

**Stories don't make as much sense with hardware honestly. A lot fo time is spent preparing for construction that doesn't create unique user stories (there are no new UX from selecting parts). Also, a lot of time is spent 1) testing hardware and 2) actually connecting hardware**

### Sprint 1: Design 

  Goal: To finalize a design for the free space optical system, including plans for incremental testing. This design requirements are discussed in the requirements documents.
  
  Story: DelphinO Delta (DoD) is a customer requiring secure, fast communication between two abitrary, moving points. The design must meet the project obectives outlines in the requirements documentation. These communications are to be used in hostile environments and must be resilient communcation with explainable design.

### Sprint 2: Parts Selection

  Goal: To find parts meeting design requirements and price limitations. These decisions are shown in the decision matrices.
  
  Story: As a researcher, Ian wants a system that can operate as designed within budget. He requires parts that meet specifications, without adding delays to the building timeline.

### Sprint 3: Hardware Construction/Interface

  Goal: Assemble parts and test individual components to confirm they operate as intended. Interfaces must be constructed on the software side
  
  Story: As a researcher, Ian wants to be able to send data easily using standard TCP or UDP connections to allow for easier connections with existing libraries. The software must connect as an internet port 'behind the scenes'

### Sprint 4: Hardware Continued and V&V

  Goal: Finish construction of MVP and perform fiber and unidirectional free space V&V to test parts individually.
  
  Story: As a customer, Natalia wants to be sure that each piece is working as intended and that no piece is simply 'barely functioning' and simply passed minimal testing. Rigorous testing is required to ensure this.

# LOE per story (estimated)

Sprint 1 - Design : 30hr (done before start of Agile work so not included specifically)
Sprint 2 - Parts Selection: 30
Sprint 3 - Hardware Construction/Interface: 30
Sprint 4 - Hardware Continued and and V&V: 27
