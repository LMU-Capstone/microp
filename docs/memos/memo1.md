Week 1:

This week we got our project approved and found a workable solution for optical free space communicationw within our budget of $500. Naval communications operate in the optical and infrared range (1)(2). Specific wavelengths of military communication are classified. We chose a 875nm wavelength solution because we found studies on low-power 875nm free space optical communication systems. We found and began researching an open-source system developed by Twibright for free space communication within our budget (3). We setup our temporary website on Wix and setup a GitHub pages website with the eventual goal of moving to a GitHub website.
